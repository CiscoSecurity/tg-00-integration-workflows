`Cisco Threat Grid API Docs <https://panacea.threatgrid.com/mask/doc/mask/api-getting-started>`_

A list of Threat Grid scripts can be found `here <https://github.com/CiscoSecurity/tg-01-basics>`_.

Threat Grid has four primary uses: submitting samples for analysis, using the data, curated feeds, and organization sample
data. Most, if not all, tasks that can be completed within the Threat Grid UI can be performed using APIs.

Receiving an API Key
--------------------
The primary means of authentication is the Threat Grid API key. The ``api_key`` parameter identifies the user and authorizes
their access to the API.

1. Login into the Threat Grid `console <https://panacea.threatgrid.com/mask/>`_.
2. Click your username in the upper right corner and scroll down to API
3. Click show and copy your API Key
4. Under "Can Download Sample Content Via API" select ``True``
